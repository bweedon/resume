    \lettersection{About Me}
    I'm a software engineer that has 8 years of experience working on applications of different sizes and types. At Proactis(then Perfect Commerce), I started off as an intern while I was in my final semesters of college at Christopher Newport University. When I graduated, I was offered a full-time position. I worked as a software engineer, adding value to the different multi-tenant products that I worked on. 

    I left Proactis for Progeny Systems after two and a half years. At Progeny Systems, I worked on multiple smaller Java applications(most web applications), got a glimpse into the power of AWS and it's competitors with a couple web applications I worked on, and learned about the government contracting world. 

    After a year and a half, I returned to Proactis as the lead(and only) developer on one of the products I worked on previously.  This product was a multi-tenant C\#/.NET application. Over the rest of my career at Proactis, I led development on two different Java multi-tenant web applications. I didn't enjoy being a lead at this company, but I was able to transition back to a software engineer, where I was able to focus more on adding value technically to the products, which I enjoyed much more.

    \lettersection{Why TODO THE COMPANY}
