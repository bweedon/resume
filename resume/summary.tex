\begin{cvparagraph}
    Software Engineer that is part of a scrum team that fixes bugs and adds features to two different SaaS solutions.  

    I have the patience to deal with older technologies and the existing expectations of those systems,
    but I am enthusiastic and eager to upgrade those technologies when the opportunity presents itself and it makes sense.
    Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve my own and the team's development workflow, productivity, and code quality. 

    I really enjoy working on the challenging problems that come with working on distributed systems and large codebases.
    Jumping into the rabbit hole keeps things interesting.
