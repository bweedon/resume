\begin{cvletter}

    \lettersection{About Me}
    I'm a software engineer that has 8 years of experience working on applications of different sizes and types. At Proactis(then Perfect Commerce), I started off as an intern while I was in my final semesters of college at Christopher Newport University. When I graduated, I was offered a full-time position. I worked as a software engineer, adding value to the different multi-tenant products that I worked on. 

    I left Proactis for Progeny Systems after two and a half years. At Progeny Systems, I worked on multiple smaller Java applications(most web applications), got a glimpse into the power of AWS and it's competitors with a couple web applications I worked on, and learned about the government contracting world. 

    After a year and a half, I returned to Proactis as the lead(and only) developer on one of the products I worked on previously.  This product was a multi-tenant C\#/.NET application. Over the rest of my career at Proactis, I led development on two different Java multi-tenant web applications. I didn't enjoy being a lead at this company, but I was able to transition back to a software engineer, where I was able to focus more on adding value technically to the products, which I enjoyed much more.

    \lettersection{Why Spotify?}
    Spotify is something my family and I use multiple times a week. I would love to be able to help add value to something so influential on so many people's day-to-day lives. The unique technical challenges that Spotify has to solve based on the amount of traffic on a day in and day out basis is something I would be extremely interested in working on solving.

    The fact that Spotify puts such an emphasis in providing great benefits, hiring the right people, then letting them work where it would be best for them through your Work From Anywhere policy shows that you all care deeply about your employees.

    \lettersection{Why Me?}
    I believe I would be a great fit for the Senior Backend Engineer working on the platform team. Helping other developers be more productive and get feedback on their code quicker is something I am very interested in.

    At my current job, we didn't have anything like a developer platform, but it was something that I felt like would have made a huge difference in developer productivity and happiness. I always gravitated towards solving the problems that we needed to work on that dealt with builds and deployments, so I feel that working on the platform team would be right up my alley. I haven't worked with an application that works at the scale that Spotify does, but I feel like it is a challenge that I would love to take on.
