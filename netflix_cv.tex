\begin{cvletter}

    \lettersection{About Me}
    I'm a software engineer that has 8 years of experience working on applications of different sizes and types. At Proactis(then Perfect Commerce), I started off as an intern while I was in my final semesters of college at Christopher Newport University. When I graduated, I was offered a full-time position. I worked as a software engineer, adding value to the different multi-tenant products that I worked on. 

    I left Proactis for Progeny Systems after two and a half years. At Progeny Systems, I worked on multiple smaller Java applications(most web applications), got a glimpse into the power of AWS and it's competitors with a couple web applications I worked on, and learned about the government contracting world. 

    After a year and a half, I returned to Proactis as the lead(and only) developer on one of the products I worked on previously.  This product was a multi-tenant C\#/.NET application. Over the rest of my career at Proactis, I led development on two different Java multi-tenant web applications. I didn't enjoy being a lead at this company, but I was able to transition back to a software engineer, where I was able to focus more on adding value technically to the products, which I enjoyed much more.

    \lettersection{Why Netflix?}
    I believe that Netflix would be a great fit for me. It would be an amazing opportunity to work on something that my family uses every day and help make it better. Not to mention being able to work on challenges that only a few technology companies ever face. 

    Based on reading the “We are Netflix” page, it sounds like there are not any policy or procedures that are in place for some reason that nobody knows about, but you follow them anyway because people fear change. There are not any guide rails or hard stops for what you can see or what you can do and with the right people like Netflix has shown, that will result in amazing results. 

    \lettersection{Why Me?}
    I believe that I would be a great fit at Netflix working with the Core Engineering team on the Productivity tools. Over the past year I have gravitated to the infrastructure work that would make other developers lives easier on my team with the products we work on and that is why I would want to work on Productivity tools. 

    I know that my experience is not with a company as big and up to date on the technical side of releasing software, but I feel that my ability to pick things up quickly will allow me to come up to speed quickly. I am looking forward to hearing back and if we end up being a good fit, facing the unique technical challenges that come with working at Netflix.
